(I fucking love this background color)

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

I'm [erri120](https://github.com/erri120), one of the [Developers](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/contributors) behind [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack) and a modding veteran for ~[7 years](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/6672467).
As a professional scientist in the field of extreme indulgence in bodily pleasures and the manifestation thereof in video games, I have decided to create a Modlist involving said sinful acts of debauchery.

Now for real: If you want a fully featured and functional Modlist that is playable from start to finish, containing multiple quest, overhauls and sexual mods than you've come to the right GitHub repository.

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)
- A brain, eyes and time to read through this README

### System Specs

- CPU: >= 7th gen Intel processor OR >= AMD Ryzen 3000 series processor
- GPU: >= 1060, you need at least 6GB of VRAM
- RAM: >= DDR4 with at least 16GBs

Everything should be installed on an SSD that has at least 256GB of space available.

## Installation

### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Steam Config

##### Disable the Steam Overlay

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the _General_ tab and un-tick the _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_ checkbox.

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language to English

Just do it. This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. I highly recommend playing the game in English and **I will not give support to people with a non-English game**.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Skyrim

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/`.

#### Start Skyrim

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the _Options_ menu.

1) Click on _Ultra_
2) Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
3) Set _Antialiasing_ to _Off_
4) Uncheck _Windowed Mode_ and _Borderless_

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

### Using Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Let's get to the actual installation. Grab the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/erri120/lotus/releases).

Download the release to a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root level of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in the _working folder_.

#### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1) Open Wabbajack
2) Load the Modlist from Disk
3) Adjust the download and installation paths
4) Click the Go/Begin button
5) Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you loose no progress.

**Could not download x**:

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till I update the Modlist.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

### Post-Installation

Download the latest ENB Series from [here](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) and copy `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` to your game folder.

Copy the following files from the `Game Folder Files` directory to your game folder:

- `enbseries/*`
- `binkw64.dll`
- `d3dx9_42.dll`
- `discord-rpc.dll` (only if you want discord RPC)
- `enblocal.ini`
- `enbseries.ini`
- `skse64_*`
- `tbb.dll`
- `tbbmalloc.dll`

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## Important Mods you should know about

This section contains information about some of the most important mods in this setup. I made this section so end-users know exactly what mods change what and can read-up on stuff they find interesting as well as give props to the mod authors.

### SexLab - Frameworks

You know this would be first, didn't you...
[SexLab Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/91861-sexlab-framework-se-163-beta-8-november-22nd-2019/) is the core of all installed LL mods. Do note that this is a **beta build**. [SLAL](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5328-sexlab-animation-loader-sse/) or _SexLab Animation Loader_ and [SexLab Aroused Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5482-sexlab-aroused-redux-sse-version-29/) are included as well.

Since we don't judge your fetishes, I have included [Creature Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5462-creature-framework-se/) and [More Nasty Critters](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5464-more-nasty-critters-special-edition/).

[Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5878-devious-devices-se-beta/) sadly does not work for SSE **yet**, but once that is around, it will of course be included.

[ZAZ](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/) is a requirement for other mods and I have included the [ZAZ 8.0+ CBBE HDT Rev3](https://mega.nz/#!WEgGDaCa!wAho2Rphy47Lcd55DEmV50GgN07CMnTjhQ_r9s6dq-I) version.

### BakaFactory

`BakaFactory`/`factoryclose`/`바보공장` is the creator of many mods used in this setup. I **highly recommend** checking out the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BaboFactory) page and [Discord](https://discord.gg/gbHGCgB) server.

Mods used:

- [SexLabAroused Redux V28b SSE Modified by BakaFactory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SlvS2KRY6UscQisro8GEskwCCKg4Wa3G/view)
- [Animated Beast's Cocks(ABC) For users LE / SE 1.34V](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7556-animated-beasts-cocksabc-for-users-le-se/)

- [SexLab Approach Redux by BakaFactory LE / SE 1.25V](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8077-sexlab-approach-redux-by-bakafactory-le-se)

### SexLab - Animations

[More Nasty Critters](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5464-more-nasty-critters-special-edition/) and [ZAZ](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/) already come with some animations, but I have expanded upon that with [BakaFactory's SLAL Animation](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6707-bakafactorys-slal-animation-le-sse/) and [Psyche Animation](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11477-psyche-animation-lesse/).

Links:

- [More Nasty Critters Special Edition 12.01](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5464-more-nasty-critters-special-edition/) original by [MadMansGun](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/71862-madmansgun/)
- [ZAZ Animation Packs for SE 1.0.0](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/)
- [BakaFactory's SLAL Animation LE / SSE 3.1V](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6707-bakafactorys-slal-animation-le-sse/) by [BakaFactory](#bakafactory)
- [Psyche Animation (LE/SSE) 1.0.5](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11477-psyche-animation-lesse/) by [PsycheHHH](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/1643961-psychehhh/)

### SexLab - Gameplay

All those animations and features from the frameworks need to be used somewhere. A lot of big quest mod are still not converted and it will take some time for LL to make the switch to SSE. That being said, the _biggest_ quest mod in this setup is [From The Deeps](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8663-from-the-deeps-for-sse/). Ask innkeepers for some rumors to pick up this lovecraft-like story! [Amorous Adventures](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/109518-amorous-adventures-34-sse-for-lovers-lab/) is also included, because it's funny. [Bestial Essence](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10036-bestial-essence-se/) for all beast lovers.

The vanilla quests are not being left alone! [SexLab Solutions](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10742-sexlab-solutions-revisited-se/) will offer additional dialog that may lead to some _interesting_ outcomes.

If you want some _wholesomeness_ than take a look at the included [Spouses Enhanced](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5266-spouses-enhanced-se/). This mod features no _extreme_ content. The focus is the relationship between two consenting, married adults.

The complete opposite of wholesome are [Defeat](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9152-sexlab-defeat-sse/), [Simple Slavery](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6535-simple-slavery-plus-se/) and [Radiant Prostitution](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10046-radiant-prostitutiongigolo-se/). Do note that I am using [Sexlab Defeat Baka Edition](https://www.patreon.com/posts/32912602) instead of normal Defeat.

[Sexlab Approach Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8077-sexlab-approach-redux-by-bakafactory-le-se) uses the new keywords of [SexLabAroused Redux Modified by BakaFactory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SlvS2KRY6UscQisro8GEskwCCKg4Wa3G/view) to cure the blindness of all NPCs around you. From the mod page:

> Now when certain conditions are met, npcs will chase after you and ask something. Some of them are after solidifying a friendship or some of them are just after your sexy body and want to have sex with you. Sometimes these chasings get messy and the relationship can be broken at some point. And they will hate you, or they will even attempt to rape you.
> Now what are you gonna do? Accept their offers without hesitation, which will make you vulnerable and then it makes you let them enjoy your body regardless of your will? Or will you decline every each one of them and act like an asshole? An aggressive, stubborn girl would do that. But they will hate you at the end and they are highly likely to try to rape you. It could be way more complicated when you are pretty.

Do note that this mod is female-oriented. [Sexlab Approach Redux for HIM](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10074-sexlab-approach-redux-for-him-se/) exists but I have yet to include it.

[SexLab Deadly Drain](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9905-sexlab-deadly-drain-sse-port/) is for all succubus lovers. This mod works for any gender and you do not have to be a Vampire or Succubus. I found this to be the most compatible succubus like mod.

### SexLab - Others

The following mods have a more _supportive_ role and do not fit any of the other categories.

[Sexlab LightMeUp](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8275-sexlab-lightmeup/) will illuminate the current SexLab scene so you don't have to pull out any additional torches and can actually see whats happening.

[Wet Function Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9467-wet-function-redux-se/) and [Blush When Aroused](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10774-blush-when-aroused-se/) add some extra effects when certain conditions are met.

[Wintersun - SexLab Integration](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10796-wintersun-sexlab-integration-se/) provides a bridge between SL and [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506).

[ViVi's Beastess Lairs](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9932-vivis-beastess-lairs-se/) adds new player homes all around Skyrim in form of caves.

[Equipable Horse Cocks](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9903-sos-equipable-horse-cocks-sse-port/) because the SL strap-on sucks (I have created COBJs so you can craft them).

### Nomkaz

You may have seen his name pop up a few hundred times when browsing the [Skyrin: Special Edition](https://www.loverslab.com/files/category/163-skyrim-special-edition/) category on LoversLab. This dude converted everything. Check his profile and leave a nice comment for all his work!

- [LL Profile](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/2695162-nomkaz/)

### 3PCO

3PCO or [3rd Person Camera Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18515) aims to fix the stiff, unmoving vanity camera of vanilla Skyrim. This mod gets its own section due to the impact it has when you have never seen nor used it before.

### Nemesis vs FNIS

We all know of [FNIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038) but have you heard of [Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main)? I won't go into much detail on the relationship between those two programs and their authors but tl;dr: Nemesis is an alternative to Fnis.

"_Why would I care?_", you may ask. [The Ultimate Dodge Mod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2VgBVA9jE6RaFNyZURxa3JXUjQ/view) is, as the name implies, a dodge mod like [TK Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15309). TUDM only works with Nemesis. I originally wanted to use TUDM and Nemesis but creature animations do not work in Nemesis _yet_.

- [TK Dodge SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15309) by [tktk1](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3841389)

### Combat - Melee

I originally wanted to use The Ultimate Dodge Mod (see [Nemesis vs FNIS](#nemesis-vs-fnis)) but had swap to [TK Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15309).

Aside from some fancy dodging, I have included [Ultimate Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17196), the new [Sekiro Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31915) and [Wildcat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368) to make melee combat interesting and somewhat challenging.

Do note that [Skyrim Souls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859) is installed meaning that you can't just go into your inventory and eat 100 cheese wheels while everything is paused.

### Combat - Archery

Can't have a setup without [AGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24296) and [ABT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4683).

### Combat - Magic

Instead of just grabbing [Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090) and calling it a day, I have opted to *not include Apocalypse*. This is my first setup since I started modding where I have not used that mod. In its stead [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488) and [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) are included.

[Spell Research](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20983) gives your mage playthrough a bit more depth as you can now _research spells_... duh.

### EnaiSiaion

Same as the [BakaFactory](#bakafactory) section, this one is a shout-out to [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191). Be sure to check the [r/EnaiRim](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnaiRim) subreddit, the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/EnaiSiaion) page and the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/GfYzjPm) server.

Mods used:

- [Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)
- [Vokrii - Minimalistic Perks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26176)

- [Summermyst - Enchantments of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285)

### Skills, Perks and More

As you may have guessed from the [EnaiSiaion](#enaisiaion) section, I used a lot of those mods. Let's break it down:

[Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) was probably one of the greatest mods released last year. The mod adds religion and worship. [Wintersun SexLab Integartion](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10796-wintersun-sexlab-integration-se/) will provide a way for Wintersun deities to react to SexLab-related events. I recommend checking out both mods if you want some religion in Skyrim.

Perk overhauls. Same with [Magic](#combat---magic), I normally always go [Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137) and nothing else. For this setup I used the new [Vokrii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26176), also made by [EnaiSiaion](#enaisiaion). This perk mod is not as huge as Ordinator but allows one to add other perk overhauls on-top of it. [Smithing Perks Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19246) and [Path of Sorcery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6660) are the ones I added.

Alchemy and Cooking is often left alone since no-one really uses those hidden op skills, but I have included the popular [CACO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924) if you want to dive into this complex crafting system.

On the topic of crafting: [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12885) will help everyone who doesn't wanna be a smith in every playthrough. [Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608) **is not included** in this setup.

If you are not the warrior type but more of a mage than [Summermyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285) and its new enchantments are what you want.

Werewolf and Vampire overhauls can be problematic with certain LL mods but I have found the new [Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) and the old [Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928) to be working just fine in this setup. Do note that the Alternate Start option where you start as a Vampire does not work with Sacrosanct (see [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/54/) article for more info).

I love [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315) as a race overhaul but I often find myself suffocating with new effects and spells from other mods so instead the somewhat new and lightweight [Morningstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22298) was the way to go.

[Thunderchild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1460) and [Andromeda](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14910) have no real alternatives for me so they are a constant in all my playthrough.

[But wait, there is more...](https://forwardsandbookwords.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/but-wait-theres-more.jpg):

[Special Perks form Questing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29402) and [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) will make Quests and Exploration more rewarding as you often get useless stuff as a reward. Now you get experience or special perks.

### Quest Mods

Aside from the quest mods mentioned in [SL Gameplay](#sexlab---gameplay), there are some _normal_ quests you can play through. The biggest one being [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802). I don't think I need to explain why that mod is included in this setup.

Aside from Lotd you get the continuation of one of my favorites quest mods for Oblivion: [Maids 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/189).

[Moon and Star](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4301) is the dwemer quest mod in this setup and [Clockwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155) will give you a nice player home and some spooky events.

The vanilla quests are not being left alone: The _For Good Guys_ lineup with [Dark Brotherhood for Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/519), [Thieves Guild For Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10745), [Namira for Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/336) and [Boethiah for Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/329) is included as well.

To round out our assortment of quests you get [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) for a large number of localized radiant quests and [MLU](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058) for those nice rewards.

### Character Mods

(If you have no idea what HDT-PE/HDT-SMP/BBP/TBPP or 3BBB is, read [this](https://babofactory.blogspot.com/2019/10/what-is-hdt-pe-hdt-smp-bbp-tbbp-3bbb.html) article by [BakaFactory](#bakafactory))

Since the dawn of mankind we've asked the question: _CBBE or UNP?_

Short answer: I went with [CBBE 3BBB Advanced](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11063-cbbe-3bbb-advanced/).

Long answer: Maybe Ill write one later. This was the hardest decision to make for the Modlist and I could go into great detail and trace back all steps that lead to this decision but I don't think anyone wanna read that.

[XMPSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988), [CBPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224) and [HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872) are of course installed and configured. For textures I used [Demoniac](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19355), [Female Dragonic Argonian Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1442) and [Feminine Khajiit Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/183).

The dudes were not left alone either! [Schlongs of Skyrim](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5355-schlongs-of-skyrim-se/) can't be missing from any LL setup. Textures used are [Tempered Skins for Males](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902) the male counter part to Female Dragonic Argonian Textures: [Male Dragonic Argonian Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1443).

### NPC Retextures

The start makes [Superior Lore-Friendly Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510). It's a small but highly effective mod. I love the work of [Pandorable](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41216925) and used [Pandorable's NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19012), [Pandorable's NPCs - Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30680) and [Pandorable's NPCs - Dawnguard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24135) as my goto NPC retextures.

The Bijin lineup with [Bijin Wives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11247), [Bijin NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11287) and [Bijin Warmaidens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1825) fills the gaps that Pandorable's mods leave.

[The Men of Winter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10902) retextures some Men in Skyrim. I handpicked NPS from [The Ordinary Women](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12376) and [Kalilies NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30247). The rest is covered by [Diversity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5291) and [Fresh Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13789). [Ethereal Elven Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24273) is the base for all elves.

The priority looks like this (similar to MO2, the ones at the bottom overwrites the ones at the top):

1) Ethereal Elven Overhaul
2) Fresh Faces
3) Diversity
4) Kalilies NPCs
5) The Ordinary Women
6) The Men of Winter
7) Bijin Wives
8) Bijin NPCs
9) Bijin Warmaidens
10) Pandorable's NPCs - Dragonborn
11) Pandorable's NPCs - Dawnguard
12) Pandorable's NPCs

[Modest Elderly](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7935) protects the elders since I hope none of us wants to see that.

### Followers

All of your sexual adventures in Skyrim should not be experienced alone! Follower mods on LL are kinda _meh_ and since this is SSE there are even less than normal so I only added 5 mods.

The first one being [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) because its funny and his dynamic dialogue is really good. He might not fit this Modlist so you can just ignore him if you want to keep your harem of ladies. You can find him in [Dead Man's Drink](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dead_Man%27s_Drink).

[Shindara](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10094) is not fully voiced with non-vanilla sounds but it's a Follower and Dungeon mod in one and my favorite Redguard. You can start the quest by talking to Hulda in the [Bannered Mare](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Bannered_Mare) or travel directly to a new location called _Scorchstone Excavation_ which is north-west from [Drelas' Cottage](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Drelas%27_Cottage).

The other three followers came from LL:

[Veronica](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8781-veronica-the-flirty-imperial-milf-se/) can be found at the [Silver-Blood Inn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Silver-Blood_Inn), [Abigail](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8773-abigail-the-lusty-imperial-maid-se/) at [Breezehome](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Breezehome) or roaming around Whiterun and the two new [Succubus Follower](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9972-succubus-follower-spells-player-armor-and-psq-transform-addon/) in the [Temple of Dibella](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Temple_of_Dibella).

### Music

I could not help but to include my favorite Skyrim music mod: [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578). It's lore-friendly Dark Folk (Nordic) music which may not really fit this Modlist but I fucking love it so here you go.

[Dreams and Nightmares](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25416), another mod adding dark and melancholic exploration tracks.

### Cathedral Mods

"_The [Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19515) is a comprehensive visual overhaul for Skyrim. It is performance friendly, consisting mostly of re-textures, improved models, and lighting modifications, so that you can use it as a foundation without having to worry extensively about compatibility._" - Introduction for the Cathedral mods

I choose to use most of the Cathedral mods in this Modlist for the reasons above. The most important one you need to watch out for is [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791). This is the weather mod for the Modlist and if you want to swap out the ENB, than you need one that is compatible with this weather mod.

### Outfit Mods

(read [Character Mods](#character-mods) first)

There are way too many outfit mods out there. This is also highly subjective and you can always just change outfits you don't like (see [Outfits](#outfits) section).

The most prominent outfit authors in this setup are of course [DeserterX](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3373573) and [docteure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/43643027) + [Jeir](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/84177) ([Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/docteur87andJeir)). Highly recommend you follow them and leave an endorsement on their mods.

For vanilla outfits I used the BodySlide files that come with [CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198) and added the converted [Spice Gear Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68028) and [Minidress Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376) by [tiwa44](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3347902). The CBBE conversion can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16321) and [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16322), made by [Gigist](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/16558474).

I like the Spice Gear + Minidress Collections because it a good middle between slutty and boring vanilla and serves as a nice baseline to build upon.

And boi do we go slutty with the next one: [The Amazing World of Bikini Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9547) originally by made by [NiseTanaka](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1575830) ([Original Oldrim mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83383)) and converted by [Daymarr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/8194845) to CBBE SE.

[Realistic Eyeglasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11807) is a mod which I always want to add but never find for some reason. Whenever I start a new modding setup for Skyrim and start downloading outfits, I always look forward to getting this mod but forget the name once I actually search for it. Anyways, those are the best eyeglasses you will find on Nirn. Do they fit this Modlist? Maybe. I fucking love them so deal with it.

### Exclusive Outfits

### Weapon Mods

Most used weapon mods came from [johnskyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3165110). Those are:

- [Radzig Longsword](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16059) contains both a one-handed and two-handed sword from Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Can be both be smithed using the Skyforge or found in the Guard Barracks of Whiterun
- [The Lionheart](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15076) shield from WoW, can be smithed under the _Daedric_ category
- [Sulfuras - The Reclaimed Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14199) two-handed hammer from WoW, can be obtained at the end of a [dungeon](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/64628-2-1428782512.jpg)!
- [Shadowmourne](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12081) two-handed Axe from WoW, can be obtained at the end of a dungeon with a dope boss fight!
- [Dragonblade AQ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29341) one-handed sword based on the Dragon Blade from Adventure Quest. Can be found on a cliff overlooking [Dragontooh Crater](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragontooth_Crater) ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/XtnDpxj.png)) or can be forged under the _Daedric_ category
- [Blade of Evil's Bane](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28881) one-handed weapon based on the Blade of Evil's Bane from the Legend of Zelda. Can be found [here](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/28881/28881-1567955685-1349624090.png), embedded in a skull/rock north of Morthal.

Our ranged characters also get a bit of love with [DX Faction Crossbows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4047). You need specific crafting manuals to craft those.

[Artifacts - The Tournament of the ten Bloods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15264) has some amazing equipment you can get through a quest. You can start the quest by reading _The Story of Lyrisius_ in the Arcanaeum.

Vanilla artifacts are fucking useless. [Zim's Immersive Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138) is in every setup I do and will give those under-powered artifacts a reason to exist in your inventory.

### ENB: Silent Horizon

ENBs for Special Edition never really convinced me. [SnowFall Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79335) singlehandedly made me stay with Oldrim for 3 years since it came out. I choose [Silent Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543) for this Modlist, mainly because of its performance and set of features. It is also compatible with [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791), the weather mod of this list.

If you have a Titan V and more FPS than you need, check the [ENB](#enb) section for ENBs you can swap to.

## Adding more Mods

### Textures

Textures are by far the easiest mods to install. Simply install the mod and check what other mod also changes the same textures in MO2. The only textures that could be problematic are landscape/environment textures like new mountain textures.

### Meshes

Similar to [Textures](#textures) just slap them into MO2. Just be careful that those new meshes are for outfits as those should be compatible with the character body of this setup (see [Character Mods](#character-mods)).

### Animations

New animations can be easily added depending on the category. You have to differentiate between [SLAL Animations](#slal-animations) and [Normal Animations](#normal-animations). The former being animations for Sexlab and the later being animations like [Pretty Sit Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10399).

#### SLAL Animations

[SLAL](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5328-sexlab-animation-loader-sse/) or _Sexlab Animation Loader_ requires special animations. You should only install additional Sexlab animations if those are made for SLAL.

Simply install them and re-run FNIS. If the animations come with an ESP, than you will have to jump into xEdit or zEdit and find out what the ESP adds/changes. Most ESPs of animations simply add animations objects and do not change any vanilla records. These ESPs can be loaded anywhere in the loadorder.

#### Normal Animations

Simply install the new animations and re-run FNIS. You might want to take a look at [FNIS PCEA2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13281) if you want those new animations to be player exclusive.

### Outfits

Another category of mods you can easily add to this setup. You only have to make sure that the outfits fit the character body (see [Character Mods](#character-mods)). It's also a good idea to find BodySlide files for that outfit so you can customize it.

Install the outfit and, optionally but highly recommended, merge the outfit in the `Armor - Merged` merge. Use the `Merge Plugins Hide` to activate all plugins from that merge, open zMerge, add the esp to the merge and rebuild it. Make sure you disable all plugins with `Merge Plugin Hide` when you're finished.

I recommend you take a look at [this](https://www.patreon.com/file?h=21212492&i=3571021) PDF if you want to fully integrate the outfit into the setup. If the outfit contains high heels, check out [Heels Sound](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/1795-heels-sound/) and change the Footstep Set of the Armor Addon to `AngelFSTHeelsFootstepSet`.

### ENB

The weather mod used in this Modlist is [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791) and the lighting mods are [Luminosity Lighting Overhaul - The Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16830) (see [Cathedral Mods](#cathedral-mods)) and [Enhanced Lighting for ENB (ELE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1377). If you want to swap out the ENB, make sure that it is compatible with Cathedral Weathers and looks somewhat decent with Luminosity and ELE. You could try and swap the those two mods with any other weather + lighting mod but this may disrupt the visual consistency that the entire Cathedral lineup has.

Other ENBs you can use (not tested, experience may vary):

ENBs that work with Cathedral Weathers:

- [Silent Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543)
- [Ljoss - Semi-realistic performance preset with Nighteye and ENB Light support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30971)

ENBs that maybe work with Cathedral Weathers:

- [Rudy ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4796)
- [NVT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11203)
- [PRT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743)
- [Apex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18042)

## Tweaking Performance

My Setup:

- i7-7700k running at ~4.6 GHz
- 1060 6GB OC to ~1800MHz
- 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM
- Game and MO2 running on an SSD

### Tweaking the ENB

This should always be the first thing you tweak. Disabling the ENB entirely can give you anything from 20 to >70 FPS. The ENB this Modlist comes with (see [ENB: Silent Horizon](#enb-silent-horizon)) is rather performance friendly. Open the ENB GUI using `Right Shift + Enter` (`Right Shift` is under the `Enter` key). This will open up the ENB GUI where you can enable and disable certain effects in the left panel.

- `Bloom`: Can give you up to 3 FPS, will make light sources less bright
- `DepthOfField`: Can give you up to 10 FPS, disabled by default and not really suited for gameplay
- `Ambient Occlusion`: This one is a big hitter. You can get up to 20 FPS by disabling this but the effect is very noticeable
- `Distant/DetailedShadow`: Those two can really give you a lot of FPS back depending on your shader settings (game settings). They are very noticeable.
- `ComplexFire/ParticleLights`: You won't see a lot of difference at first when disabling those two, but when particles are on screen (eg using magic or near light sources such as fires), they can _burn_ through your FPS

### Tweaking the Game Settings

I highly recommend using [BethINI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875) which is included in this Modlist (can be found in `MO2/tools/BethINI`). I recommend tweaking the `Detail` section for more FPS:

- `Shadow Resolution`: Very big one. A good balance is `2048` which is the borderline between high FPS drainage and garbage looking shadows.
- `Ambient Occlusion`: Highly recommended to leave this at `None`. The ENB this Modlist comes with, uses the ENB SAO which is 10x better and performance friendly than base game SAO.
- `Detailed Draw Distance`: Maybe try `2000` instead of `2800` but you won't notice a lot of FPS gain (maybe 1-3)
- `Remove Shadows`: If you really struggle, use this. This will disable all Shadows (not recommended)

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## Contact

While I'm always available on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack), I would advise checking the [Issues](https://github.com/erri120/lotus/issues) (open **and** closed ones) on GitHub first if you have any problems. The same goes for _Enhancements_ or _Feature/Mod Requests_.
